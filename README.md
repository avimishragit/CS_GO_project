CS-GO Project
It is an Machine Learning project. 

Counter-Strike has evolved over the years with different versions, including Counter-Strike 1.6, Counter-Strike: Source, and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO), which is the most recent and widely played installment as of my last knowledge update in September 2021.

CS:GO is known for its competitive gameplay, professional esports scene, and ongoing updates that have kept the game relevant and enjoyable for players worldwide. It remains a cornerstone of the first-person shooter genre.
